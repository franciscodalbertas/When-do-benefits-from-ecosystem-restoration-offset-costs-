# When do benefits from ecosystem restoration offset costs?

The raster with total restoration cost can be downloaded from the link:

The raster with potential for carbon sequestration is at the rasters folder.

The scripts to generate the farm-level scenarios and the regional-level scenarios are as following: 
- **farm-level** = optimization_scenarios.
- **regional-level** = optimization_scenarios_rl.R

The properties boundaries and APP limits for the municipalities considered in this study can be obtained from the adress: 
- https://www.car.gov.br/publico/imoveis/index. 

The list of municipalities is located at the file "list_mun.csv" within the tables folder. Each property (n=507) is identified with an unique ID. The dataframe contains: the predicted yield in coffee bags/ha (*predictec_coffee_bags*); yield in USD/ha (*yield_USD_future*); the difference in yield bewteen the future scenarios and the baseline scenario (*diff_USD*); the net present value of the difference between the future scenarios and the baseline (*npv_yield_USD_future*)

The raster with land-use and land-cover classes can be downloaded from the link: 
- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MzchKACl3wKVLR24oAHOGtbWvx8s-W4_/view?usp=sharing
 - class 0: all other uses;
 - class 1: natural vegetation;
 - class 2: coffee;

The estimated yield per property is at the yield_estimation.csv file. 

The script "merging_scen_land_use.R" was used to combine the restoration scenarios generated by the optimization model with the baseline land-use and land-cover;
