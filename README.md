The raster with potential for carbon sequestration is at the rasters folder.

The scripts to generate the farm-level scenarios and the regional-level scenarios are above.

The properties boundaries and APP limits for the municipalities considered in this study can be obtained from the adress:

The list of municipalities is located at the csv file "list_mun.csv".

The raster with land-use and land-cover classes can be downloaded from the link:

 - class 0: all other uses;
 - class 1: natural vegetation;
 - class 2: coffee;

The script "merging_scen_land_use.R" was used to combine the restoration scenarios generated by the optimization model with the baseline land-use and land-cover;
